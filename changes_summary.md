# AdminBridge - Email System Update

## Changes Summary

We've fixed the email notification system that was previously not working. Now when any user creates a new employee, the system will automatically send an email to that employee with their login credentials (email, password) and login URL.

## Key Updates

1. **Email Sender Improvements**:
   - Updated the email sending process in `backend/utils/email_sender.py` to properly handle Node.js script execution
   - Improved error handling and logging for better debugging
   
2. **Node.js Email Service**:
   - Fixed `backend/utils/emailService.js` to properly queue and send emails
   - Added promise-based API for better error handling
   - Added validation for email configuration
   
3. **API Integration**:
   - Updated `backend/api/views.py` to ensure emails are sent for all employee roles (not just certain roles)
   - Added better error handling to prevent API failures when email sending fails
   
4. **Configuration**:
   - Updated email configuration in both root and backend directories
   - Added clear instructions for setting up Gmail credentials
   
5. **Testing Tools**:
   - Added improved test scripts for verifying email functionality
   - Created `testSimpleEmail.js` for quick email testing
   
6. **Documentation**:
   - Added comprehensive setup guides:
     - `EMAIL_SETUP_GUIDE.md` in the root directory
     - `backend/utils/EMAIL_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for backend-specific details

## How to Test

1. Update your email credentials in `emailConfig.js`
2. Run `node testSimpleEmail.js` to verify basic email functionality
3. Create a new employee through the application interface
4. Verify that the employee receives login credentials via email

## Next Steps

1. Set up your Gmail credentials in the email configuration files
2. Test the email functionality
3. Monitor logs for any email-related issues
